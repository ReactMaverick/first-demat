        Can You Open a Demat Account If You Already Have a Trading or Commodity
        Account Offline?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many investors wonder if they can open a Demat account even if they
        already have a trading or commodity account. The answer is yes! Here’s a
        quick guide to help you understand the process and benefits.
      </p>
      <h2>Understanding the Difference</h2>
      <p>
        A trading account is used to buy and sell securities, while a Demat
        account is used to store those securities in electronic form. Having
        both accounts allows you to trade and hold your investments seamlessly.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Open a Demat Account?</h2>
      <p>
        A Demat account is essential for holding shares and other securities. It
        simplifies the process of managing your portfolio and ensures the safety
        of your investments.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps to Open a Demat Account Offline</h2>
